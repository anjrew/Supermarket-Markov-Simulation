# Supermarket-Markov-Simulation

This project is a Markov Chain simulation of a supermarket, modeling customer behavior. The simulation uses probability transitions to generate realistic customer actions, such as browsing, purchasing, entering, and leaving the store 🏪

The simulation is implemented in Python, utilizing NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, and cv2 for visualization. The project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and store operations, and can be easily modified to simulate different scenarios and store layouts.
